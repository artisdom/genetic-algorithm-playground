So the end decision will be made by our geneticly growing neural net, but there will be another set of inputs that comes from a FNN that tries to score every position for it's likelyhood to win us this game. The reproduction step will be 1. Perform gradient descent on the memory, 2. Combine and mutate the parents. This will act as a sort of historical memory of all games played"
